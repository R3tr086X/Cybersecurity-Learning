# Workplace Security Policy – Risk Analysis & Controls

## Project Overview

This project presents the design of a security policy for a medium-sized company (150 employees, two offices) undergoing digital transformation.

The company manages:

- Corporate laptops, mobile phones and tablets  
- Internal servers and storage systems  
- Cloud services  
- CRM and ERP platforms  
- Customer data through an online store  

Current security controls are basic and there is no formalized role-based security policy.  
This project identifies assets, vulnerabilities, threats, risk scenarios and proposes appropriate technical, organizational and physical controls.

# Executive Security Policy

## Assets

- Corporate laptop  
- Corporate mobile phone and tablet  
- Privileged credentials  
- Remote access to internal systems  
- Sensitive strategic documentation  

## Vulnerabilities

- Use of public WiFi networks  
- Weak or reused passwords  
- Lack of full disk encryption  
- Exposure to targeted phishing  
- Physical exposure during business travel  

## Threats

- Device theft or loss  
- Credential theft via phishing  
- Unauthorized access to ERP/CRM systems  
- Malware infection via attachments  
- Identity impersonation  

## Risk Scenarios

1. Executive loses mobile device at an airport → Exposure of email and sensitive documents  
2. CFO impersonation attack → Fraudulent financial transfer  
3. Public WiFi usage without VPN → Credential interception  
4. Spear phishing campaign targeting executives  

## Security Measures

### Technical Controls

- Full disk encryption on all devices  
- Mandatory Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)  
- VPN required for remote access  
- Mobile Device Management (MDM)  
- Automatic screen lock (1–2 minutes)  

### Organizational Controls

- Executive-focused security awareness training  
- Information classification policy  

### Physical Controls

- Secure travel procedures  
- No unattended devices policy

## Key Risks

- Malware via email attachments  
- Customer data leakage  
- Web-based attacks  
- Social engineering  

## Technical Controls

- Antivirus with web protection  
- Hardened browser configuration  
- Network segmentation  
- Strong passwords + MFA  
- Restricted ERP access based on role  

## Organizational Controls

# Administrative Role Security Policy

## Main Risks

- Physical access to unlocked workstation  
- Malware via USB devices  
- Printed data exposure  
- Ransomware via phishing emails  

## Technical Controls

- Automatic screen lock  
- USB device restriction policy  
- Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)  
- Antivirus and anti-spam protection  

## Organizational Controls

- Clean desk policy  
- Secure document destruction procedure  
- Basic phishing awareness training

# Security Checklist Example

- Is MFA enabled for all privileged accounts?  
- Are corporate devices encrypted?  
- Is network segmentation implemented?  
- Are employees trained to detect phishing?  
- Are USB ports restricted where necessary?

# Conclusion

Different roles present different risk profiles:

- **Executives** → High privilege and mobility risks  
- **Online Store Staff** → Internet exposure and customer data risks  
- **Administrative Staff** → Physical and internal system risks  

A role-based security approach combining technical, organizational and physical controls significantly reduces overall risk exposure.
